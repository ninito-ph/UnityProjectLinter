<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Unity Project Linter is a simple tool that allows you to ensure asset naming conventions are being followed in your project.

Here are its features:
* Ensure assets names have the necessary prefixes and suffixes.
* Ensure asset names don't have spaces.
* Customize existing rules easily.
* Create new naming rules, even for complex cases, by extending the NamingRule class.
* Ignore individual assets or entire folders from naming rules.
* Receive console warnings when an asset is renamed or created and does not match naming rules.
* Export a log of assets that violate naming rules.
* Mass-rename assets that violate rules.
